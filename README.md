Hi! I'm a Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft. I got into development when I started automating my job with excel macros and realized coding is life. Now I enjoy working in technologies with two letter abbreviations: AI/ML, MR/VR/XR/AR. But really, I loves all things tech and enjoy building with many technologies. Outside of programming I love yoga, music, ukulele, biking, puppies, and whatever flavor of the year hobby has caught my attention.
