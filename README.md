Hi! I'm a Cloud Developer Advocate at Microsoft. I enjoy working in technologies with two letter abbreviations: AI/ML, MR/VR/XR/AR. But really, I loves all things tech and enjoy building solutions with many different technologies. Outside of programming I love yoga, musical instruments, biking, puppies, and whatever flavor of the year hobby has caught my attention.
